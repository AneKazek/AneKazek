The first time I coded was when I entered 7th grade of junior high school, the first language I used was C++ as a basis for developing my project using Arduino Uno. Until now I have made many Arduino projects where some of my projects have been able to enter Provincial and International Competitions I'm currently developing 4 Arduino based projects for my school which will soon be taking part in a Provincial Level Competition Apart from using C++, I am also interested in Python and also Dart.
